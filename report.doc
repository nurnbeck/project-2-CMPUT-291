a) General Overview
The user is first taken to a menu with all six functions: Create and populate a database, Retrieve records with a given key ,Retrieve records with a given data, Retrieve records with a given range of key values, Destroy the database, and Quit.

b) Design
1 Create and populate a database:
	in case of Btree/hash, creates selected database type and fills with entries, and records the initial time and the time elapsed to fill each

2 Retrieve records with a given key:
	goes through each key in selected database and compares key to key being searched and data is decoded and returned to index file, index file treated as a hashtable and run time is found and  stored accordingly.
	
3 Retrieve records with a given data:
	same process as key search but the dictionary is accessed in an opposite as data is provided and

4. Retrieve records with a given range of key values:
	prompt user for upper and lower bounds of database to be searched

5. Destroy the database:
	accesses mkdir and rm's the database and secondary database.

6. Quit:
	Return out of main function and end program.

(d) Group Work Strategy
- Method of Coordination
We split the work into modules and worked independently on our portions and helped one another if that person encountered a bug that they found difficult. 
 
(e) work load

Nolan Beck: main(), cr_DB()
Hong Chen: ret_KEY(), ret_RANGE()
Yishuo Wang: ret_DATA(),ret_RANGE()
